                        I am currently a senior at the University of Houston â€“ Clear Lake, majoring in computer science
                        and will graduate this December. This year, I focused on participating in internships and
                        designing projects using various front and back end tools. I recently completed an internship at
                        NASA where I developed 2 Python modules that were used for machine learning. For my senior
                        project, I created a sports data API using machine learning for game predictions. My proposal
                        was among 4 out of the 30 proposals selected to be worked.

                        <br>
                        My passion is designing web development or machine learning applications. While they seem
                        like two completely different fields, I find them to be very similar. They both allow me to
                        play with different ideas: through trial and error, I develop a product I am ecstatic to
                        share.

                        Science at the University of
                        Houston â€“ Clear Lake. I have no regrets about a pretty big life decision I made several years
                        ago: moving from Washington state to Texas. I love it here!
                    </p>

                        <span class="ml-5">Two</span> facts I wish were true: one, I am a Seattle Native (which I am
                        not), two, I have loved
                        computer science since I was 9 years old (which I didnâ€™t).
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead"><span class="ml-5">I</span> arrived in Seattle when I was about 5 years old.
                        Originally born in La
                        Encarnacion, Villanueva,
                        Zacatecas, Mexico (I know, itâ€™s a mouth-full), a tiny town in the middle of nowhere where a
                        small river literally divides the town in half. How small is the town? Letâ€™s just say I am
                        related to about half of the residents. So then we moved to the United States, and not just any
                        city â€“ Seattle! Talk about a shift in culture and landscape. My first few years in Seattle came
                        with challenges. First, my elementary school did not have ESL (English as a Second Language)
                        classes. Nevertheless, I moved up a grade every year despite not really understanding what was
                        going on in class â€“ until I reached 4th grade. I will never forget my 4th and 5th grade teacher,
                        Ms. Susan Brown. She was the only elementary teacher that really showed interest in my success.
                        She helped start the first ESL program at Medina Elementary in Bellevue WA, spent a few summers
                        teaching me math, reading and writing and most importantly: she put me in a big brother program
                        at school for one year. That big brother, Paul Bartelmas, became one of the most influential
                        people in my life. If it wasnâ€™t for those two people, I am sure I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead"><span class="ml-5">And</span> as for loving computer science; I looked at my first
                        lines of code several year
                        ago while
                        working at a small construction store in Seattle. The owner said the website needed an upgrade.
                        He told me to look over the HTML/CSS files and see if I can change the background add images;
                        spark the site a little bit. After 15 minutes of looking at text (I had never looked at any
                        code), I told my manager I could not upgrade the website. Nevertheless, that moment of not being
                        able to complete a task stayed on my mind. Even though I didnâ€™t start programming at a very
                        young age, I was always fascinated by how electronics worked. Growing up I took apart toys,
                        radios, VCRâ€™s and TVâ€™s. Though I was able to fix most items, I often had left over screws when
                        putting them back together. After finishing high school, I had my own computer. Naturally, I was
                        eager to take it apart. I spent several weeks learning about the hardware and somewhere I
                        read about Linux. So, I did what any curious kid would do, I reformatted the hard drive with
                        Linux, then back to Windows then dual booting it with Windows and Linux. Soon after that, my
                        curiosity about computers and software, along with my failure of not being able to upgrade a
                        website lead me to learn Java. I spent about 4 months teaching myself how to program in Java. As
                        I was searching for Java documentation online, I came across Python. I put Java aside and
                        started learning Python. After one month of Python, I decided computer science was my passion.

                    <p class="lead">
                        <span class="ml-5">I</span> love to solve problems. Whether itâ€™s finding an efficient solution
                        for a line of code or
                        fixing something at home. I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions.
                        Thatâ€™s why I love fixing electronics and the satisfaction that comes from seeing it work again.
                        Itâ€™s why I study web development and machine learning to solve modern day problems. I can spend
                        all day programming, documenting, learning, failing and doing it all over every day. I can now
                        look at HTML, CSS, JavaScript and several other languages for web development. Now, I just think
                        back and laugh at how I couldnâ€™t upgrade a simple website. As long as there is a problem or
                        challenge to overcome, I know itâ€™s bound to be something I love.
