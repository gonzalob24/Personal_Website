				My Story
			</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row pb-5">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="ml-5">My</span> name is Gonzalo Betancourt, and I’m a
							senior studying Computer Science at the University of Houston –
							Clear Lake. I have no regrets about a pretty big life decision I
							made several years ago: moving from Washington State to Texas. I
							love it here!
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="ml-5">Two</span> facts I wish were true: one, I am a
							Seattle Native (which I am not), two, I have loved computer
							science since I was 9 years old (which I didn’t).
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="ml-5">I</span> arrived in Seattle when I was about 5
							years old. Originally born in La Encarnacion, Villanueva,
							Zacatecas, Mexico (I know, it’s a mouth-full), a tiny town in the
							middle of nowhere where a small river literally divides the town
							in half. How small is the town? Let’s just say I am related to
							about half of the residents. So then we moved to the United
							States, and not just any city – Seattle! Talk about a shift in
							culture and landscape. My first few years in Seattle came with
							challenges. First, my elementary school did not have ESL (English
							as a Second Language) classes. Nevertheless, I moved up a grade
							every year despite not really understanding what was going on in
							class – until I reached 4th grade. I will never forget my 4th and
							5th grade teacher, Ms. Susan Brown. She was the only elementary
							teacher that really showed interest in my success. She helped
							start the first ESL program at Medina Elementary in Bellevue WA,
							spent a few summers teaching me math, reading and writing and most
							importantly: she put me in a big brother program at school for one
							year. That big brother, Paul Bartelmas, became one of the most
							influential people in my life. If it wasn’t for those two people,
							I am sure I wouldn’t be where I am today.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="ml-5">And</span> as for loving computer science; I
							looked at my first lines of code several year ago while working at
							a small construction store in Seattle. The owner said the website
							needed an upgrade. He told me to look over the HTML/CSS files and
							see if I can change the background add images; spark the site a
							little bit. After 15 minutes of looking at text (I had never
							looked at any code), I told my manager I could not upgrade the
							website. Nevertheless, that moment of not being able to complete a
							task stayed on my mind. Even though I didn’t start programming at
							a very young age, I was always fascinated by how electronics
							worked. Growing up I took apart toys, radios, VCR’s and TV’s.
							Though I was able to fix most items, I often had left over screws
							when putting them back together. After finishing high school, I
							had my own computer. Naturally, I was eager to take it apart. I
							spent several weeks learning about the hardware and somewhere I
							read about Linux. So, I did what any curious kid would do, I
							reformatted the hard drive with Linux, then back to Windows then
							dual booting it with Windows and Linux. Soon after that, my
							curiosity about computers and software, along with my failure of
							not being able to upgrade a website lead me to learn Java. I spent
							about 4 months teaching myself how to program in Java. As I was
							searching for Java documentation online, I came across Python. I
							put Java aside and started learning Python. After one month of
							Python, I decided computer science was my passion.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="ml-5">I</span> love to solve problems. Whether it’s
							finding an efficient solution for a line of code or fixing
							something at home. I love the challenge of finding a way and
							discovering solutions. That’s why I love fixing electronics and
							the satisfaction that comes from seeing it work again. It’s why I
							study web development and machine learning to solve modern day
							problems. I can spend all day programming, documenting, learning,
							failing and doing it all over every day. I can now look at HTML,
							CSS, JavaScript and several other languages for web development.
							Now, I just think back and laugh at how I couldn’t upgrade a
							simple website. As long as there is a problem or challenge to
							overcome, I know it’s bound to be something I love.
